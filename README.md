# ASHS
Absolute Simple HTTP(S) Server


This is exactly what it is called. A simple, single-class template for you to make a backend server for your website. It has all functions pre-made to handle different URL requests. These include home-page, sub-pages, file requests, and parameters/values. 

In addition to the main class from which you will extend to create your own, I also included a very simple example class that is plug-and-play so you can see how it works.
